							<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Miguel</strong>. And I love computer science (when I'm not
								getting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it" target="_blank">NullPointerExceptions</a>). I strive for creative, elegant, and remarkable design in my work, while maintaining a healthy balance with efficiency. </p>

							<p align = "left">I went to South River High School in Edgewater, MD, where I built my knowledge base for STEM fields
								under Project Lead the Way, a program that guided me to graduation
								with varied fields of Engineering courses under my belt. Looking back, these courses
								and my demanding teachers instilled in me the virtues of patience and attention to detail that are now so imperative in the field of computer science.</p>
							
							<p align = "left">I transferred to the University of Maryland intending 
								to become an engineer. However, one thing led to another, and I eventually
								realized my passion for computer science. I am now enjoying new projects like developing Android applications, designing and implementing a database, and this website, which I designed mainly with HTML and CSS. I am graduating on May 2018 and I am currently a Corporate Technical Intern for an IT solutions company for the Spring 2017 semester.</p>

								<div class="col" style="max-width: 60%;">
									<p class="desc">Working for Paradyme has been an absolute pleasure. As a Corporate Technical Intern, I get my first real taste of what it is like to be a professional. I've learned what its like to work with others in a company that's thriving, but I've also learned to work independently and develop my research skills when necessary.</br>
									</br>
									My team is currently working on a Database project, and I'm learning all the basics of designing and implementing a database. Through this project, I am learning on the fly how to code in Python, and gaining experience using the web-framework Django. I have also become familiar with MySql and the Windows command prompt. </br>
									</br>
									Being here has also taught me about the importance of company culture. Though the work is very demanding, everyone here is happy because of the kind of environment we are in. Paradyme is diverse and makes an effort to celebrate and observe differences in traditions. The CEO, Viraj Ghandi, takes the time to interact with us interns directly and show that he cares, and he always shows what it takes to not only start a business, but to make it successful and continue growing. From him, I am learning some of the techniques to becoming a successful businessman, especially in the tech industry.

									<p class="desc">My time at Thompson Creek Window Company really opened my eyes to the importance of marketing in business. As part of the marketing team, we encouraged and competed against each other through our marketing goals. Here, I learned an array of marketing and sales techniques.</br>
									</br>
									I started this job off with no marketing or sales experience. But by the end of my tenure, I was competing with people who trained me. I had achieved a high of setting seven in-home customer appointments with a Thompson Creek foreman in a 4 hour shift. To put some perspective, an average day for anyone would be two.</br>
									</br>
									Working here allowed my communication skills to improve significantly. I felt my confidence in myself and my ability to express myself swell up. But more importantly, I learned how to persevere. Any salesman knows that there will be awful days, but here I became more thick-skinned and willing to look past the bad days and focus on the present.

							<div class="row">


								
								<div class="col" style="max-width: 65%;">
									<p class="desc">My first job was at Checkers as a regular crew member. I was part of the original crew that worked in the grand opening of the fast-food chain in Crofton, MD. The environment here was fast paced, and I had to learn to be efficient. In fact, I would get so overwhelmed that I made an algorithm of sorts to be as efficient as possible when doing my tasks. </br>
									</br>
									I was first trained as a cashier, becoming customer service oriented, but eventually I became proficient in all stations of the restaurant, and became one of their most versatile employees. After a year, I had been promoted to "blue shirt" which meant that managers could relay responsibilities to me when they needed to step out. I became a leader in making sure the day-to-day operations went as smoothly as possible. By the end of my tenure, I was offered a full time managerial position.</br>
									</br>
									Working here taught me some lessons that only people who have worked in fast-food can learn. For one, I learned there is so much more work involved in the job than the depiction of a bored employee in that TV show you watched recently seems to imply. Especially in slow days when less employees work and spikes in customers can be difficult to cope with. It is also humbling to work with people whose very lives rely on the same job that you can live without. No task is too small or too large if you value your job. I think my experience here allowed me to grow as a person and be more perceptive of the situations of people of different backgrounds.

								</div>

								<div class="col" style="width: 65%;">
									<p class="desc">During my internship at GEMS I met a lot of wonderful people like me who didn't know what they wanted to do. Though I had an inclination for the tech industry, I wasn't sure exactly what I would be willing to do every day as an adult. GEMS was great because they taught me through various hands-on activities without getting too deep into each topic.</br>
									</br>
									One project in particular was very memorable because I worked on making a character on a video game do simple tasks. I programmed it to move forwards, left, right, backwards, and also attack enemies. The attack was particularly complex because its success depends so much on position. Though this project didn't convince me to pursue computer science, I think that looking back, in some unconscious way, it played a role in my decision.

Anyways, this beauty to the right is my computer that I built last summer. Actually, just a month ago, I added the tempered glass, which is why the window looks so sleek and has that tinted look.</br>
									</br>

									This beast of a machine is headlined by an Intel i5-6600k CPU, Asus ROG Strix GTX1060, and a 250gb SSD, all encased by a Cooler Master MasterCase Maker 5 for optimum performance and cooling. If you know a lot about computers, you're salivating by now. For a full list of parts, go <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/intherenzone/saved/NLXXsY" target="_blank">here</a>.</br>

However, its not all about games. Virtual Reality is a growing industry and for way more reasons than I thought imaginable before joining this club.</br>
									</br>

									Not only do you get to test VR equipment in this club, but you also get to learn from some people who have experience with VR. In fact, the VR club often has a guest speaker come visit campus and talk about different elements of VR. I've learned a lot and the classes the club has hosted recently are really helpful.

The food, the sights, the people are unlike any other. Going there always reminds me how much I miss my family and how privileged I am to live in a country with so much more opportunities than many of the people there.</br>
									</br>
									Other than that, I've been to many states around the country. The adventure of traveling to a new place is exciting. I've visited the Grand Canyon, Vegas, the Carolinas, Delaware, Virginia, and New York among others. Traveling has really opened my eyes to different cultures, traditions, and norms, and I appreciate these opportunities that I know many people don't get often.

									</br>

									I enjoy trying out new ways of staying in shape, whether its a new class at a gym someone wants me to try out, or just a new work out I saw online. In fact, I've learned that the more varied your work outs, the better, because your body won't get used to any particular form of excercise. I've also started to watch what I eat, avoiding fast-food and eating out when I can. In fact, I've started to enjoy cooking a lot and could cook you a pretty good steak (if you hire me).</br>
